Notifications are a powerful tool in Android developer’s toolkit to keep users up-to-date about events happening inside your Android app, even when users are not looking at your app directly.

In fact, a well-timed and useful notification is a great way to tempt users into launching and using your Android app, especially when they haven’t seen our app in a while.
